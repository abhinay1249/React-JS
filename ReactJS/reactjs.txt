ReactJS ----------------------> An external library that helps us create websites easier.

    ** React library is used for both website and mobile apps.
    ** React DOM library is used only for websites particularly.
    ** In order to create websites both react and reactDOM are used majorly.
    ** ReactDOM.createRoot() is used to set up React.
        eg:- ReactDOM.createRoot(<html element>)
    ** .render() is used to display something in react.
    ** BABEL = is a javascript complier.
        --> used to translate other languages into javascript.
    ** When using react, we use enhnaced version of JS i.e JSX
    ** JSX = JavaScript XML
        --> Same as javascript, but we can write html in our js code.
    ** WebBrowser doesnt understand JSX, so we need to translate jsx into js.
        --> In order to perform that translation we use babel. 

Components ------------------------> A piece of a website

    ** In react, the component name has to be start with Capital.
    ** In react if there is a function and it can be called by defining it
        through a tag of the function name(just like creating the respective xml tags).
