ReactJS ----------------------> An external library that helps us create websites easier.

    ** React library is used for both website and mobile apps.
    ** React DOM library is used only for websites particularly.
    ** In order to create websites both react and reactDOM are used majorly.
    ** ReactDOM.createRoot() is used to set up React.
        eg:- ReactDOM.createRoot(<html element>)
    ** .render() is used to display something in react.
    ** BABEL = is a javascript complier.
        --> used to translate other languages into javascript.
    ** When using react, we use enhnaced version of JS i.e JSX
    ** JSX = JavaScript XML
        --> Same as javascript, but we can write html in our js code.
    ** WebBrowser doesnt understand JSX, so we need to translate jsx into js.
        --> In order to perform that translation we use babel. 

Components ------------------------> A piece of a website

    ** In react, the component name has to be start with Capital.
    ** In react if there is a function and it can be called by defining it
        through a tag of the function name(just like creating the respective xml tags).
    ** Main Idea of React is to create self elements.
    ** Fragment is used to remove the element but maintain the code syntax by using
        <>
            <input/>
        <>
    ** In react div are used for the layout purpose.
    ** Every component function does contains props,
        props --> parameter in the function that captures the attribute of the html and 
            works as a parameter in the function.
            shortcut for properties is props.
    ** A way to destructure the if statement in js, instead if and condition is through guard operator(&&)
        we can use {<condition> && <inside condition statements>}
            eg:- {message==='robot' &&  break;}
    ** In order to call a component in the react through render use 
        .render(<App/>)
    ** In react, while working with event handlers the event prop has to be in camelCase and should not 
        run the event handler function rather just the event handler.
    ** In order to Get a random id on javascript use,
        ======>> crypto.randomUUID();

STATE ------------> data that is connected to the HTML.

    ** when we update the data it will update in Html.
    ** In order to use a state in react js then we should use
        React.useState() this returns an array which contains two values:-
            --> it returns the current data
            --> it returns the updater function.
    ** In Js, an array can be copied into another one by using Spread Operator such as,
        ...<array_name> performs the copy operation.  
    ** Never use DOM while performing react, it occurs a conflict while performing rather than it   
        use react features.
    ** Previously, we had worked around onClick where it runs the function when clicked.
        Now, onChange ---> runs a function when we change the text inside an input.
        While performing onChange, an object is taken as event and by using it,
            event.target.value --> is used to give us the element that we are typing in.
    ** STATE is even used to save data that changes over time.
    ** If we need to have to an access for the state of one component in another state then we need to perform.
        lifting the state up --> this can be done by moving the required state to the parent component 
            such as for eg:- to the APP component and then the state can be shared using props.
    ** In react, state does not update immeditely, instead it updates after all the code is finished.
    ** Update the state == Update the website.

CSS WITH REACT -----> styling the page with react

    ** here the class attribute name is className for styling elements.
    ** overflow:scroll is used for the scroll of the container
    **scrollbar-width is used to hide the scroll bar on the screen.
    ** Hooks --> insert react features into our component.
        useEffect --> is used to run some code after component is created or updated.
        useRef --> is used to automatically save an HTML element in this ref.
    ** Any variable with Elem states that particular variable has html code in it.
    ** hook functions must start with 'use'
