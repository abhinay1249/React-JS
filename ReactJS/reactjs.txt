ReactJS ----------------------> An external library that helps us create websites easier.

    ** React library is used for both website and mobile apps.
    ** React DOM library is used only for websites particularly.
    ** In order to create websites both react and reactDOM are used majorly.
    ** ReactDOM.createRoot() is used to set up React.
        eg:- ReactDOM.createRoot(<html element>)
    ** .render() is used to display something in react.
    ** BABEL = is a javascript complier.
        --> used to translate other languages into javascript.
    ** When using react, we use enhnaced version of JS i.e JSX
    ** JSX = JavaScript XML
        --> Same as javascript, but we can write html in our js code.
    ** WebBrowser doesnt understand JSX, so we need to translate jsx into js.
        --> In order to perform that translation we use babel. 

Components ------------------------> A piece of a website

    ** In react, the component name has to be start with Capital.
    ** In react if there is a function and it can be called by defining it
        through a tag of the function name(just like creating the respective xml tags).
    ** Main Idea of React is to create self elements.
    ** Fragment is used to remove the element but maintain the code syntax by using
        <>
            <input/>
        <>
    ** In react div are used for the layout purpose.
    ** Every component function does contains props,
        props --> parameter in the function that captures the attribute of the html and 
            works as a parameter in the function.
            shortcut for properties is props.
    ** A way to destructure the if statement in js, instead if and condition is through guard operator(&&)
        we can use {<condition> && <inside condition statements>}
            eg:- {message==='robot' &&  break;}
    ** In order to call a component in the react through render use 
        .render(<App/>)
    ** In react, while working with event handlers the event prop has to be in camelCase and should not 
        run the event handler function rather than just the event handler.
    ** In order to Get a random id on javascript use,
        ======>> crypto.randomUUID();

STATE ------------> data that is connected to the HTML.

    ** when we update the data it will update in Html.
    ** In order to use a state in react js then we should use
        React.useState() this returns an array which contains two values:-
            --> it returns the current data
            --> it returns the updater function.
    ** In Js, an array can be copied into another one by using Spread Operator such as,
        ...<array_name> performs the copy operation.  
    ** Never use DOM while performing react, it occurs a conflict while performing rather than it   
        use react features.
    ** Previously, we had worked around onClick where it runs the function when clicked.
        Now, onChange ---> runs a function when we change the text inside an input.
        While performing onChange, an object is taken as event and by using it,
            event.target.value --> is used to give us the element that we are typing in.
    ** STATE is even used to save data that changes over time.
    ** If we need to have to an access for the state of one component in another component then we need to perform.
        lifting the state up --> this can be done by moving the required state to the parent component. 
            such as for eg:- to the APP component and then the state can be shared using props.
    ** In react, state does not update immediately, instead it updates after all the code is finished.
    ** Update the state == Update the website.

CSS WITH REACT -----> styling the page with react

    ** here the class attribute name is className for styling elements.
    ** overflow:scroll is used for the scroll of the container
    **scrollbar-width is used to hide the scroll bar on the screen.
    ** Hooks --> insert react features into our component.
        useEffect --> is used to run some code after component is created or updated.
        useRef --> is used to automatically save an HTML element in this ref.
    ** Any variable with Elem states that particular variable has html code in it.
    ** Hook functions must start with 'use'

REACT SETUP AND NODEJS -------------> Install Node Js

    ** A node let us run javascript code outside of a browser.
    ** npm stands for Node Package Manager.
    ** A package refers to the external library.
    ** npm will let us install external libraries into our project.
    ** npx is used to install and run the package in the command line.
    ** create-vite command is used to set up a new React project.
    ** eslint is used to correct the javascript code.
    ** Vite is a tool that is used to set up this project.
    ** react/prop-types=off is used to turn off the props of in the code that stops eslint to check 
        for errors.
    <StrictMode> give us some additional checks and warnings when developing an app.
    ** npm runs = tells the computer to look inside the package.json for a section called "scripts".
    ** dev = look inside the "scripts" for "dev" and run the command on the right side of the "dev"(which is vite).

ROUTING ---------------------> Let us create multiple pages in React

    ** <Routes> tells react that all pages in the website.
    ** <Route> is a page, i.e it adds a page to our website.
    ** Route has a element and path attributes in it in which they are used to navigate the webpages,
            eg:- <Route path="/checkout" element={<HomePage/>}
    ** SPA is known as Single Page Application which means,
            --> we only have 1 HTML File.
            --> we use React for multiple pages.
    ** In <Route> instead of using path="/" we can use index
    ** Since we are using routing, no need to reload the page, 
            Javascript is used to switch between pages using <Link> component.
    ** <Link> is used to go to another webpage without reloading.
    ** The link component uses a prop called to instead of href.
    ** While using react-router usage of link is better than a, as it speed up the process a little bit.

REACT WITH BACKEND, DATA FETCHING --------------> In order to get the products from backend.

    ** In order to map a list of products from an array we can use .map() function.
    ** But when using it and generating the products from backend we need to include an unique identifier for it
            by using key{}.
    ** In order to show the decimal values upto a respective digits use .toFixed(<number>).
    ** Backend is something, which is used to store and manage the data.
    ** Data Fetching ---> gets data from the backend.
    ** In order to get and fetch data use the function,
        fetch()
    ** fetch() returns a promise, where in a promise let us wait for asynchronous code to finish,
        a promise has method called .then()
    ** When a request is made to the backend, then for the method .json() need to be attached for the data to receive
        as a respone.
    ** asynchronous code cannot be saved in a variable.
    ** axios is a cleaner way to make requests from the backend.
    ** In useEffect use can create a dependency array such that it runs only once after the component is created.
        eg:- useEffect(()=>{
            <'[]' is the dependency array>
        },[]);
    ** Server-Proxy Connection is used to set the port number for easy way of access rather than putting in url everytime.
        server:{
            proxy:{
                '/api':{
                    target:'http://localhost:3000'
                }
            }
        } ----> it is used to identify if the url starts with /api then it recognises the port setup in vite.config.js.
    ** <base href="/"> is used to add / infront of any relative urls.
    ** Async await is a feature of JavaScript that let us write the asynchronous code.
    ** In react instead of promises, async - await is recommended.
    ** In App.jsx, Incase the parameters need to be updated then it needs to be fixed through the
        :orderId & :productId are called "URL Params".

DATA MUTATION -------------------------> Update data in the backend

    ** To get data from backend, use axios.get('/api/cart-items');
    ** To create data in backend, use axios.post('/api/cart-items');
    ** By using post we can even send an object known as request body axios.post('<url>',<object>)
    ** In React, Hooks can be defined on the higher level rather than in the low level such as in loops etc.
    ** Axios has different types:-
        * get - axios.get('api/cart-items')    ---> get some data
        * post - axios.post('api/cart-items')  ---> create some data
        * put - axios.put('api/cart-items')    ----> update some data
        * delete - axios.delete('api/cart-items') ---> delete some data
    ** Each api call has a type and a url to perform actions on data.
